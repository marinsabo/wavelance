# Wavelance 🌊  
[🔗 Live Preview](https://wavelance.42web.io/?i=1)

A **modern, conversion-focused landing page** I designed and developed to practice building professional business websites.  
The goal was to create a sleek, minimal, and trustworthy presentation for a fictional LinkedIn-growth service called **Wavelance**.

## 🧠 Concept  
The concept behind *Wavelance* is to represent **momentum, flow, and growth** — like a wave — translated into a clean digital brand identity.  
I wanted the layout and tone to feel **agency-grade**, while keeping performance and clarity as priorities.
